Open Eligibility
===============

The Open Eligibility Project is a collaborative for a better human service taxonomy. The taxonomy is a simple way to categorize human services and human situations. With these common categories, we, as service providers, navigators, and people in need, can find human services quickly and easily.

The taxonomy is available in four formats: [XML](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/human-services/openeligibility/master/taxonomy), and much simpler  [CSV](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/human-services/openeligibility/master/taxonomy.csv), [JSON](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/human-services/openeligibility/master/taxonomy.json), and [YAML](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/human-services/openeligibility/master/taxonomy.yaml) editions.
